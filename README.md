# Investment Simulator – Portfolio Diversification + Monte Carlo

**Description:**  
This project is an interactive investment simulator that allows users to explore portfolio growth over multiple years using Monte Carlo simulations. Users can allocate a set amount of money across three types of assets (Bonds, Stocks, Startups) with different risk levels and observe the effects of diversification, random market fluctuations, and rare shock events.  

A **Teaching Mode** is included to provide step-by-step explanations of how portfolio values evolve over time, making it both educational and hands-on.  

**Features:**  
- Multi-year investment simulation  
- Monte Carlo simulation with user-defined number of runs  
- Rare shock events to simulate extreme market conditions  
- Risk diversification across multiple assets  
- Teaching Mode for educational insights  
- Visualizations:  
  - Growth path of portfolio over time  
  - Histogram of Monte Carlo simulation outcomes  
  - Average portfolio value and starting value highlighted  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python 3  
- `random` for generating stochastic returns  
- `matplotlib` for data visualization  

**How to Use:**  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
