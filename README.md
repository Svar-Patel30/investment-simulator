# Investment Simulator – Portfolio Diversification + Monte Carlo

**Description:**  
This project is an interactive investment simulator that allows users to explore portfolio growth over multiple years using Monte Carlo simulations. Users can allocate a set amount of money across three types of assets (Bonds, Stocks, Startups) with different risk levels and observe the effects of diversification, random market fluctuations, and rare shock events.  

A **Teaching Mode** is included to provide step-by-step explanations of how portfolio values evolve over time, making it both educational and hands-on.  

**Features:**  
- Multi-year investment simulation  
- Monte Carlo simulation with user-defined number of runs  
- Rare shock events to simulate extreme market conditions  
- Risk diversification across multiple assets  
- Teaching Mode for educational insights  
- Visualizations:  
  - Growth path of portfolio over time  
  - Histogram of Monte Carlo simulation outcomes  
  - Average portfolio value and starting value highlighted  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python 3  
- `random` for generating stochastic returns  
- `matplotlib` for data visualization  

**How to Use:**  
1. Clone the repository:  
git clone <your-repo-url>

Install dependencies:
pip install matplotlib

Run the simulator:
python investment_simulator.py

Follow on-screen prompts:
Enter total investment amount
Allocate funds across Bonds, Stocks, and Startups
Enter number of simulations and years
Optionally enable Teaching Mode

**Educational Value:**
- This project is designed as both a portfolio tool and a learning aid, demonstrating key financial concepts:
Risk and return trade-offs
- Portfolio diversification benefits
- Effects of rare market events
- Randomness and variability in investment outcomes
  
**Next Steps / Expansion Ideas:**
- Convert into a web-based interactive app using Streamlit
- Add additional assets (Mutual Funds, ETFs, etc.)
- Include recurring investments and compound contributions
- Compare different investment strategies (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
